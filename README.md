# HaveABreak
By Jad Rabbaa (10 November 2017). HaveABreak is a project that paces your work and break sessions through creating an arduino peripheral to the computer that talks to a p5.js webpage that triggers an IFTTT function that posts to Facebook a message that a break from work was taken. https://webspace.ocad.ca/~3164555/haveabreak
