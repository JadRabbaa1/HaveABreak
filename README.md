# HaveABreak
By Jad Rabbaa (10 November 2017). 

HaveABreak is a project created for experiment 3 (peripherals) for the Creation and computation Course at OCAD University.
The idea is to create a new peripheral to the computer ( proximity sensor that could be embedded in a laptop cooler). It aims to pace your work and break sessions through creating an arduino peripheral to the computer that talks to a p5.js webpage which triggers an IFTTT function and posts a message to Facebook a message that a break from work was taken.

There are 2 sections for this project, the first is for the arduino circle, and the second for the p5.js webpage https://webspace.ocad.ca/~3164555/haveabreak:

1- Arduino circuit with Ultrasonic proximity sensor that communicates with javascript though a serial port.

2- Web interface using p5.js with libraries:  p5.js,  p5.serialport.js , p5.dom.js , p5.gif.js that triggers IFTTT.
